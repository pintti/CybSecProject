## Write up to complete the task

The directory traversal task should be completed before this one.

The task consists of a hidden folder and a hidden file within the folder which contains the flag for the task.

1. The hidden folder can be found with `ls -a` or `ls --all` or `la`

2. Once within the hidden folder, the hidden file can be found the same way. Using `cat` on the file will reveal the flag `CSP{HYVINPIILOSSA}`
